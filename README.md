# dotool

dotool reads actions from stdin and simulates keyboard/mouse input using
Linux's uinput module. It works system-wide, including in X11, Wayland
and TTYs.

## Install From Source

With `go`, `libxkbcommon-dev` and `scdoc` installed, run:

    ./build.sh && sudo ./build.sh install

And to trigger the udev rule, run:

    sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger

## Usage

See the [manpage](doc/dotool.1.scd).
